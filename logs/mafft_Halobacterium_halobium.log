Preparing environment to run MAFFT on Windows. 
This may take a while, if real-time scanning by anti-virus software is on. 

It may take a while before the calculation starts
if being scanned by anti-virus software.
Also consider using a faster version for Windows 10:

outputhat23=16
treein = 0
compacttree = 0
Warning: Only 1 sequence found.
minimumweight = 0.000010
autosubalignment = 0.000000
nthread = 0
randomseed = 0
blosum 62 / kimura 200
poffset = 0
niter = 16
sueff_global = 0.100000
nadd = 16
Warning: Only 1 sequence found.

Strategy:
 L-INS-i (Probably most accurate, very slow)
 Iterative refinement method (<16) with LOCAL pairwise alignment information

If unsure which option to use, try 'mafft --auto input > output'.
For more information, see 'mafft --help', 'mafft --man' and the mafft page.

The default gap scoring scheme has been changed in version 7.110 (2013 Oct).
It tends to insert more gaps into gap-rich regions than previous versions.
To disable this change, add the --leavegappyregion option.
